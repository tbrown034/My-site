          Writer of the Year in the Great Plains Journalism Awards
        </a>
        contest for my work that included an examination of Oklahoma hospitals
        suing patients over unpaid bills amid the pandemic and state politicians
        who promoted misinformation before the November elections. The Great
        Plains Journalism Awards is a regional contest honoring print, web, TV
        and magazine journalists for outstanding stories, photography and
        design. The newspaper category is open to entries from organizations in
        Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota and
        South Dakota. Winners were announced Thursday by the Tulsa Press Club.
        Here are some of the other awards I have received over the years.
